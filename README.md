### About us
#### Anna:
Hi! I am Anna and my goal is to enter the world of tech and become a full-stack developer! I enjoy problem-solving, and I'm a lifelong learner with a passion for creating innovative solutions that make a difference!

#### Catrin:
I'm Catrin, I love playing video games, board games, and D&D, and I enjoy making jewellery in my spare time. I really enjoy working on the front end with HTML and CSS (and I don't mind a bit of Python). I'm hoping to be able to build my own sites for personal use as well as one day be a web/app/game developer - freelance or otherwise.

#### Dominique:
I'm Dominique, and alongside learning to code I'm currently studying for a PhD in Music. In my free time I love to go outdoors, and my favourite hobbies are climbing and hiking. I enjoy front end development the most, and hope to become a web developer in the future.

#### Eleanor:
Hello, I am Eleanor. I love to travel. I enjoy being creative and will often be designing and making items using my cricut. I want to use the coding I have learnt to create websites for my friends and family members business'. I hope to be succesful in achieving a junior position as a full stack developer and continue to gain more knowledge in the various coding languages I have been taught.

#### Karolina:
I'm Karolina and I'm a bookworm and a gamer with soft spot for sports. Because I am constantly seeking to learn new things and ways to challenge myself, I'm hoping to explore various sides of IT, which is why I chose fullstack developer stream to study. But I do prefer front end at the end of the day. My current goal is to progress further within the company I already work for in an IT entry level position.


#### Linda:
Hiya, I'm Linda!I just finished my Masters in Finance, and rounding up this CFG program as well. I have always been fascinated by how websites work and the intricate coding that went into it. I like Frontend a lot, because I like seeing the visual result of my code. In my spare time, I like to drum and play games. 


### About the app
The aim of the GeoSafe app is to provide useful safety information for the Cardiff area. Women are the main audience, due to [reports that women in the UK feel less safe when walking alone at night compared to men (links to ONS census analysis)](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/bulletins/perceptionsofpersonalsafetyandexperiencesofharassmentgreatbritain/2to27june2021), however the content may be useful to anyone who finds themselves in a potentially dangerous situation.

GeoSafe is designed to be a simple and straightforward application for easy and fast navigation in events of an emergency. The homepage is a simple, welcoming screen with a clearly-defined navigation bar and urgent support button. The top of the page provides links to each page which are clearly marked and made with user experience in mind. When the user scrolls down, theyâ€™ll find some facts and statistics about why GeoSafe is important. The app includes charts and a map for current crime statistics in the area, including a postcode search functionality on the map, a list of important numbers and addresses for local authorities, shelters, and helplines, and also a useful tips page which shows which items you can or cannot legally use for immediate self-defence in case of danger.

### How we approached building the app
We used Miro to get to know each other a bit better and learn about out strengths and weaknesses as individuals and thus as a group, to note down our ideas for the app, and for a voting system to decide which to do. We then used Moqups to wireframe our design, and then Jira for the kanban board to plan and assign our tasks. More concise information can be found in the [report]().
