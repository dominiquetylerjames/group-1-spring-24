### About the app
The aim of the GeoSafe app is to provide useful safety information for the Cardiff area. Women are the main audience, due to [reports that women in the UK feel less safe when walking alone at night compared to men (links to ONS census analysis)](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/bulletins/perceptionsofpersonalsafetyandexperiencesofharassmentgreatbritain/2to27june2021), however the content may be useful to anyone who finds themselves in a potentially dangerous situation.

GeoSafe is designed to be a simple and straightforward application for easy and fast navigation in events of an emergency. The homepage is a simple, welcoming screen with a clearly-defined navigation bar and urgent support button. The top of the page provides links to each page which are clearly marked and made with user experience in mind. When the user scrolls down, theyâ€™ll find some facts and statistics about why GeoSafe is important. The app includes charts and a map for current crime statistics in the area, including a postcode search functionality on the map, a list of important numbers and addresses for local authorities, shelters, and helplines, and also a useful tips page which shows which items you can or cannot legally use for immediate self-defence in case of danger.

### How we approached building the app
We used Miro to get to know each other a bit better and learn about out strengths and weaknesses as individuals and thus as a group, to note down our ideas for the app, and for a voting system to decide which to do. We then used Moqups to wireframe our design, and then Jira for the kanban board to plan and assign our tasks.
